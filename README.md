<div align="center">
A legal professional by training, a data scientist in the making - never stop learning.
  
I'm in final term of Master's in Data Science at Indiana University. I'm here to explore this fascinating world of data using analytics and bridging the gap between the legal and data science. Passionate about using making complex data accessible to drive meaningful change and create impact. 

âœ¨ Making the transition from Legal to Data Science one algorithm at a time!!! âœ¨
